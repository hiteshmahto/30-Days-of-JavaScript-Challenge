// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

// Task 1: WAP to add two numbers and log the result to the console
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(`5 + 3 = ${add(5, 3)}`);

// Task 2: WAP to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
console.log(`5 - 3 = ${subtract(5, 3)}`);

// Task 3: WAP to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(`5 * 3 = ${multiply(5, 3)}`);

// Task 4: WAP to divide two numbers and log the result to the console
const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
console.log(`5 / 3 = ${divide(5, 3)}`);

// Task 5: WAP to find the remainder when one number is divide by another and log the result to the console
const remainder = (a, b) => a % b;
console.log(`Remainder when 5 is divide by 3 is - ${remainder(5, 3)}`);
